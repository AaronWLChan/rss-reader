# RSS-Reader (Web)
* A responsive RSS-Reader built with TypeScript, React, Redux and TailwindCSS.
* Uses Feedly API to find RSS feeds.
* Dark Mode

## Possible Improvements
* Dedicated backend to store user data rather than using Redux and LocalStorage
* React Optimisations - in particular memoization

## Note
* During testing it was found some feeds from the Feedly API may not be accessible.

## Mobile / App Version
* See the React Native version [here](http://www.github.com/AaronWLChan).
